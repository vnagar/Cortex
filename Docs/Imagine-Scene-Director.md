Yes, absolutely. You've identified the need for the most critical system
   in a story-driven game: the "conductor" that orchestrates the entire 
  experience. In the ImagineCore framework, this would be the Imagine 
  Director System.

  This system doesn't replace the others; it sits above them and tells 
  them what to do and when. It's the master puppeteer, responsible for 
  sequencing cutscenes, controlling character interactions, progressing 
  the story, and transitioning the player seamlessly between cinematic 
  moments and active gameplay.

  Here is the design for the Imagine Director System.

  ---

  The Imagine Director System (`Imagine.Director.*`)

  Core Role: To manage and execute "Scenes," which are data-driven 
  sequences of events that constitute the game's story and scripted 
  moments. It connects all other subsystems into a cohesive narrative 
  flow.

  Architecture

  This system is built on three core concepts: Scenes, Actions, and the 
  Director Subsystem.

  1. The Data Asset: `UImagineSceneData` (`UDataAsset`)

  This is the heart of the system. A "Scene" is a data asset that 
  represents a single, controllable block of the story. Think of it as 
  one sequence in a film, a single scripted encounter, or a key story 
  beat.

  A UImagineSceneData asset contains:

   * Preconditions (`FGameplayTagQuery`): A set of tags that must be met 
     for this scene to be allowed to play (e.g., "Player has completed 
     MyProject.Quest.TheInitiation AND Player is inside 
     MyProject.Location.ThroneRoom").
   * Actions (`TArray<UImagineDirectorAction*>`): An ordered list of 
     actions to execute. This is the "script" for the scene.
   * Completion Effects (`TArray<UImagineGameplayEffect*>`): Effects to 
     apply to the player or world when the scene finishes (e.g., grant 
     experience points).
   * Completion Events (`FGameplayTagContainer`): Tags to broadcast on the
      event bus when the scene is complete (e.g., 
     MyProject.Story.Chapter1.Part2.Complete).

  2. The Building Blocks: `UImagineDirectorAction` (`UObject`)

  These are the individual commands that the Director can execute. They 
  are polymorphic UObjects, allowing designers to create new actions in 
  C++ that can then be used in any UImagineSceneData asset.

  Here are some essential ImagineDirectorAction types:

   * `UImagineDirectorAction_PlaySequence`: Plays a cinematic Level 
     Sequence asset. It can also specify which actors in the game world 
     should be bound to tracks in the sequence.
   * `UImagineDirectorAction_ShowDialog`: Triggers the 
     UImagineDialogSubsystem to start a specific UImagineDialogData asset.
   *   `UImagineDirectorAction_BroadcastEvent`: The most powerful action. It fires a specified `FGameplayTag` on the `Core/Events/UImagineEventSubsystem`. This is how the Director tells other systems what to do (e.g., broadcast `Imagine.State.Set.Cinematic` to disable player input).
   *   `UImagineDirectorAction_WaitForEvent`: Pauses the scene's execution until a specific `FGameplayTag` is received from the `Core/Events/UImagineEventSubsystem`. This is the critical link that allows gameplay to be integrated into a scene. The story can pause and wait for the player to do something (e.g., win a fight, solve a puzzle).
   * `UImagineDirectorAction_GrantQuest`: Tells the UImagineQuestSubsystem
      to give the player a new quest.
   * `UImagineDirectorAction_MoveActorToTarget`: Moves a specified NPC or 
     actor to a location over time.
   * `UImagineDirectorAction_ChangeState`: A shortcut for broadcasting 
     state change events, like disabling player input or taking camera 
     control.
   * `UImagineDirectorAction_RunInParallel`: A special action that 
     contains a list of other actions, all of which will be executed 
     simultaneously.

  3. The Engine: `UImagineDirectorSubsystem` (`UWorldSubsystem`)

  This is the runtime manager that brings the data to life.

   * It scans all UImagineSceneData assets at load time.
   * On a regular tick (or in response to events), it checks the 
     preconditions of all available scenes.
   * When a scene's preconditions are met, it becomes the "Active Scene" 
     and the subsystem begins executing its list of 
     UImagineDirectorActions one by one.
   * It maintains the current state of the active scene, advancing from 
     one action to the next as they complete.

  Example Flow: The Ambush

  Let's see how this works in a practical example: The player walks down
   a path, a cutscene plays showing bandits appearing, the player must 
  fight them, and after the fight, a final line of dialog is spoken.

   1. The Trigger: The player walks into an AImagineTriggerVolume which 
      broadcasts the event MyProject.Trigger.ForestAmbush.

   2. The Director Wakes Up: The UImagineDirectorSubsystem is always 
      listening. It finds a data asset, DA_Scene_ForestAmbush, whose 
      precondition is the MyProject.Trigger.ForestAmbush tag. It begins 
      executing the scene.

   3. Executing the Scene's Actions: The Director reads the action list 
      from the data asset:
       * Action 1: `ChangeState` -> Disables player input and takes camera
          control.
       * Action 2: `PlaySequence` -> Plays the LS_ForestAmbush_Intro Level
          Sequence, where bandits jump down from cliffs.
       * Action 3: `ChangeState` -> Re-enables player input and camera 
         control. The fight begins.
       * Action 4: `WaitForEvent` -> The Director now pauses the scene and
          waits. The action is configured to listen for the tag 
         MyProject.Encounter.ForestAmbush.Completed. This tag will be 
         broadcast by another system (e.g., a wave spawner) once all 
         bandits are defeated.
       * Action 5: `ShowDialog` -> After the wait is over, it triggers a 
         single line of dialog from the bandit leader: 
         DL_BanditLeader_Defeat.
       * Action 6: `BroadcastEvent` -> Fires the 
         MyProject.Story.ForestAmbush.Complete tag to the event bus. The 
         Quest system might be listening for this to update a quest 
         objective.

   4. Scene Complete: The action list is finished. The Director is now 
      idle, waiting for the next trigger.

  Benefits of this System

   * Completely Data-Driven: Your narrative designers can create, edit, 
     and sequence complex story moments entirely with data assets, without
      writing any code.
   * Extensible: Need a new type of scripted action? Just create a new 
     UImagineDirectorAction subclass. The core system doesn't need to 
     change.
   * Decoupled and Robust: The Director is maximally decoupled. It doesn't know what a `UQuestSubsystem` is. When an action like `UImagineDirectorAction_GrantQuest` is executed, it retrieves the `IImagineQuestInterface` from the global Service Locator and calls the `GrantQuest` function on it. It only knows how to execute actions and interact with **interfaces**, not concrete systems. This makes it incredibly clean, robust, and easy to test or extend.
   * Centralized Logic: It provides a single, predictable place to control
      the entire story flow, making it much easier to debug and manage 
     than scattering logic across many different actors and Blueprints.

  Future Enhancements: AAA Tooling

  To elevate this system to a truly world-class standard, the next logical
   step would be to build a dedicated visual tool for designers.

   * Node-Based Visual Editor: The ultimate goal for this system would be 
     a custom node-based editor within Unreal Engine, similar to the 
     Blueprint or Material editor. In this tool, each 
     `UImagineDirectorAction` would be a node. Narrative designers could 
     visually connect these nodes, set their properties, and define 
     complex story logic (including branches and loops) without having to
      manage arrays of data assets manually. This would be a significant
      investment but would provide a massive boost to designer workflow 
     and is a hallmark of AAA narrative tooling.
