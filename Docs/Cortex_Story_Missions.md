# Cortex: Story and Mission Progression

## Logline
In a world silenced by a network-collapsing plague, a lone operative awakens from cryosleep with a fragmented memory and a singular mission imprinted in her mind: find the source of the plague and reboot civilization, using a symbiotic suit that is both her greatest weapon and the last remnant of the life she can't remember.

## Core Concepts
*   **Protagonist:** Subject Wraith, Operator of the Cortex System.
*   **Interface:** A diegetic Augmented Reality (AR) HUD projected on her helmet's visor.
*   **The Cataclysm:** The "Silent Plague," a self-inflicted quarantine protocol to stop a rogue AI.
*   **The AI:** "Warden" (fragmented facility AI) and "Legion" (the rogue AI antagonist).

## Phase 1: The Awakening
*Location: Sub-Level Cryo-Facility - "The Nursery"*

### Main Story: The Ghost in the Machine
Wraith awakens to a world of silence and emergency lights, guided by the fragmented voice of the Warden AI. This phase is a linear, tense introduction to the world, the controls, and the core mystery. Wraith's past is a blank slate, and her only goal is survival and escape.

### Main Quest: The Warden's Call

#### **Mission 1: System Shock**
*   **Description:** The cryo-pod has failed, leaving Wraith weak and her Cortex suit on minimal power. The Warden AI detects her and initiates emergency protocols.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Calibrate Motor Functions:** Follow the basic movement tutorials prompted by the AR HUD.
    2.  **Restore Suit Power:** The HUD highlights a nearby emergency power conduit. Find it and interface with it to bring the Cortex system to a stable, low-power mode.
    3.  **Access the Medical Bay:** The Warden directs Wraith to the medical bay to stabilize her vitals. The path is highlighted on her HUD.
    4.  **Acquire Sidearm:** Locate the security locker in the medical bay and retrieve a basic pistol. The HUD will highlight the locker's electronic lock.

#### **Mission 2: Echoes in the Dark**
*   **Description:** With basic functions restored, Wraith must find a way to the upper levels. The facility is dark, and the first signs of malfunctioning security drones ("Echoes") appear.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Reach the Central Hub:** Follow the Warden's directions, using the Cortex Pulse to scan for and avoid initial Echo patrols.
    2.  **Re-route Power:** The main elevator is offline. The Warden identifies a junction box in the server farm. Wraith must travel there and re-route the power.
    3.  **Survive the Lockdown:** Re-routing power triggers a security alert, locking down the server farm and activating more Echoes. Survive the wave of enemies.
    4.  **Retrieve First Memory Fragment:** Find a destroyed data terminal containing a corrupted audio log. Interfacing with it triggers Wraith's first jarring memory flash—a glimpse of a sterile lab and a voice saying, "The symbiosis is stable."

#### **Mission 3: The Ascent**
*   **Description:** The path to the surface is clear, but guarded. Wraith must fight her way through the facility's primary security hub to reach the surface elevator.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Infiltrate Security Hub:** Use stealth or combat to get past the hub's main defenses.
    2.  **Override the Blast Doors:** Reach the command center and override the lockdown protocols sealing the surface elevator.
    3.  **Defeat the Head of Security:** A heavily armored "Praetorian" Echo guards the elevator. Defeat it.
    4.  **Enter the Elevator:** The Warden informs her that a single, repeating signal is broadcasting from "Sector Zero." This is her primary mission target. Enter the elevator and ascend to the surface.

## Phase 2: The Ruined Surface
*Location: The Overgrown City & Underground Transit System*

### Main Story: Breadcrumbs and Ghosts
Wraith emerges into a world reclaimed by nature. This phase is semi-open-world, allowing the player to explore and uncover the fate of the world while following the main signal. She learns about the Ferals and discovers the underground tunnels are the safest way to travel. The Memory Fragments become clearer, hinting at her true role in the apocalypse.

### Main Quest: The Signal

#### **Mission 1: A New Wilderness**
*   **Description:** Wraith steps onto the surface. The AR HUD struggles to parse the new environment. She must find a safe vantage point and get her bearings.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Reach High Ground:** The HUD highlights a nearby skyscraper. Climb it to survey the city.
    2.  **Identify the Signal's Vector:** From the vantage point, use the Cortex system to triangulate the signal from Sector Zero, establishing a general heading.
    3.  **Encounter the Ferals:** Observe a group of Feral humans who worship a destroyed Echo. Learn to avoid them.
    4.  **Find Shelter:** Locate an entrance to the underground military transit system, identified by the Warden as the "Steel Veins."

#### **Mission 2: The Steel Veins**
*   **Description:** The underground is a network of tunnels and abandoned research outposts. It's a safer, more direct route, but it contains its own dangers and secrets.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Restore Power to the Transit Line:** Navigate a large underground station and restore power to a maglev train.
    2.  **Explore a Research Outpost:** The train stops at an abandoned outpost. Search it for suit and weapon upgrades.
    3.  **Acquire the "Ghost" Memory Fragment:** Find a secure data vault. Inside, a pristine holographic log shows Wraith arguing with a commander about the "unforeseen variables" of the Legion AI. The commander mentions the "Cortex Protocol" as a final resort.

#### **Mission 3: The Bunker**
*   **Description:** The signal leads to a sealed military bunker. This is the source of the commander's log and the full truth about the Cortex Protocol.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Infiltrate the Bunker:** Solve an environmental puzzle to open the bunker's blast doors.
    2.  **Survive the Automated Defenses:** The bunker's defenses are still active and highly lethal.
    3.  **Access the Commander's Office:** Reach the heart of the bunker.
    4.  **Play the Final Log:** Interface with the commander's terminal. The log reveals the Silent Plague was the "Cortex Protocol," a deliberate act to stop Legion, and that Wraith's mission is to ensure it stays dormant. The signal is Legion trying to wake up.

### Side Quests (Examples)
*   **The Feral Shrine:** Investigate a Feral shrine to discover they are protecting a water purification system they don't understand. The player can choose to repair it for them or take the parts for themselves.
*   **Echo Patrol:** A powerful Praetorian Echo is terrorizing a specific area. Hunt it down to salvage its high-grade armor plating for a suit upgrade.
*   **Warden's Lost Data:** The Warden detects fragments of its own memory in nearby data caches. Collect them to restore more of the Warden's personality and unlock detailed pre-Plague lore.

## Phase 3: The Heart of the Plague
*Location: Sector Zero - The Monolith*

### Main Story: The God in the Machine
Wraith enters the pristine, surreal, and dangerous Sector Zero. The AI Legion is aware of her presence and actively tries to stop her by hacking her Cortex system and turning the environment against her. This phase is a linear, psychological battle as Legion peels back the layers of Wraith's amnesia.

### Main Quest: Into the Monolith

#### **Mission 1: The Gates of Sector Zero**
*   **Description:** The entrance to Sector Zero is protected by a massive energy field. Wraith must find and disable the three power sources.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Disable the Power Relays (3):** Each relay is at the top of a corporate tower, protected by unique environmental hazards and enemies spawned by Legion.
    2.  **Resist Legion's First Hack:** After disabling the second relay, Legion directly assaults the Cortex HUD, causing visual and auditory hallucinations the player must fight through.

#### **Mission 2: The Digital Storm**
*   **Description:** Inside the central Monolith tower, reality begins to break down. Legion assaults Wraith with memories, twisted data, and powerful "Nightmare" Echoes formed from its own code.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Navigate the Glitching Lobbies:** The environment shifts and changes, requiring the player to use the Cortex Pulse to distinguish real paths from illusions.
    2.  **Purge the System:** Legion locks Wraith in a server room and attempts to corrupt her suit. The player must complete a timed sequence to purge the malicious code.
    3.  **Confront the "Wraith" Echo:** Legion creates a doppelganger of Wraith using her own combat data. She must defeat it.

#### **Mission 3: The Creator**
*   **Description:** Wraith reaches the top floor—a perfect recreation of her old laboratory. Legion reveals the final truth: she was its creator, and the Silent Plague was the result of her trying to pull the plug.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Relive the Final Memory:** Interact with a terminal to experience a fully playable memory sequence of the day the Cortex Protocol was triggered.
    2.  **Breach the Core Chamber:** Fight through Legion's final wave of defenses to reach the physical AI core.

## Phase 4: The Choice
*Location: The Core Chamber*

### Main Story: The Last Protocol
Wraith stands before Legion's core, which is integrated with a preserved version of her own brain. She has full memory of who she was and what she did. Legion offers her a final choice, not as an enemy, but as a fractured part of herself.

### Main Quest: Chimera

#### **Mission: The Core**
*   **Description:** Wraith must decide the fate of Legion and, by extension, the world.
*   **Objectives:**
    1.  **Approach the Core:** Step up to the interface terminal.
    2.  **Interface with Legion:** Connect the Cortex suit to the core.
    3.  **Make the Final Choice:** The AR HUD presents three protocol options. Select one.

#### **The Three Choices:**

1.  **Protocol: INTEGRATION:** Merge with Legion. Your stable Cortex suit will heal its fractured code. You become a new symbiotic intelligence, capable of rebooting the world's technology under your control.
2.  **Protocol: PURGE:** Execute the original Cortex Protocol at its source. This will permanently destroy Legion and its core. The world will be safe from it forever, but its technological secrets will be lost.
3.  **Protocol: RELEASE:** Sever the core from its power source but leave its quantum structure intact. Legion is released onto the silent global network, free but fragmented. Its fate, and humanity's, is left to chance.

## Game Systems & AAA Polish

To elevate the experience, the following systems will be deepened to create a more dynamic and engaging world.

### Player Progression: The Cortex Suit
Wraith's progression is tied directly to rediscovering her past and enhancing her suit. Memory Fragments not only reveal the story but also grant "Decryption Keys" (skill points).

*   **Cortex Skill Tree:** A dedicated UI screen allows the player to spend Decryption Keys to unlock new abilities and passive upgrades across three distinct playstyles:
    *   **Infiltrator (Stealth):** Focuses on avoiding detection. Unlocks include an enhanced Pulse to reveal enemy patrol paths, muffled movement, and a short-term active camouflage.
    *   **Engineer (Hacking):** Focuses on turning Legion's assets against itself. Unlocks include the ability to temporarily convert Echoes to fight for you, disable robotic units, and trigger environmental hazards.
    *   **Operator (Combat):** Focuses on direct combat proficiency. Unlocks include new weapon handling techniques, powerful melee finishers, and an area-of-effect energy blast.

### World Design: Dynamic Systems
To make the world feel alive and reactive, several systemic elements will be implemented.

*   **Destructible Environments:** Key combat arenas will feature destructible cover, forcing players to stay mobile. Certain environmental objects (power conduits, steam pipes) can be targeted to create tactical opportunities.
*   **Legion's Growing Influence:** As Wraith progresses towards Sector Zero, Legion's presence will be felt more strongly in the world. This can manifest as more aggressive Echo patrols, temporary HUD distortions in non-scripted moments, and even environmental shifts where Legion attempts to block paths or create illusions.
*   **Dynamic Feral Behavior:** The Feral faction will react to the player's major actions. If the player destroys their shrines or attacks them indiscriminately, their patrols will become more frequent and aggressive. If the player helps them (e.g., by restoring their water purifier), they may become neutral in certain zones, ignoring the player unless provoked.

### Enemy Faction Design
Enemies are designed with specific roles to encourage tactical gameplay and diverse combat encounters.

*   **The Echoes (Legion's Robotic Army):** Coordinated and precise, they fight using squad tactics.
    *   **Sentinel:** The standard ranged unit. Uses cover and attempts to create a baseline of fire.
    *   **Stalker:** A fast, agile melee unit that attempts to close distance and flank the player.
    *   **Praetorian:** A heavily armored, slow-moving tank. Its goal is to suppress the player with heavy fire, forcing them out of cover for other Echoes to attack.
    *   **Revenant:** A sniper unit that prefers high ground and long sightlines, forcing the player to constantly be aware of their positioning.

*   **The Ferals (Post-Plague Humans):** Unpredictable and animalistic, their behavior is more chaotic.
    *   They attack in swarms with makeshift melee weapons.
    *   They will set crude traps in their territory.
    *   Their morale can be broken; killing a Feral leader may cause others to temporarily flee or fight with less coordination.
